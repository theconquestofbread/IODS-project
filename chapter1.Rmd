# About the project

The following documents my progress in the course **Introduction to Open Data Science**. The course includes basic *R*, *RStudio*, *RMarkdown* and *GitHub* usage, as well as several more advanced topics. I am saving all the weekly assignments and the course diary in a **GitHub repository** available [here](https://github.com/theconquestofbread/IODS-project).

# Weekly Assignments
## Week 1

```{r, echo=F}
# This is a so-called "R chunk" where you can write R code.

I have some skills in statistical methods and the use of R but I am unfamiliar with GitHub (except as a place for plundering code). I have done most of work with longitudinal register data and with parametric methods, and, based on the course description, I hope that the course would provide me new knowledge on:

* Open Data repositories
* Survey methods
* New methods (e.g. Cluster analysis).

But that's probably enough for now, more to follow during next weeks.
